# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

A sandbox for learning [ Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)](https://progressivepull.github.io/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/) is an interactive, safe environment where users can experiment with code, 
visualize algorithm behavior, and test different data structures without fear of breaking anything. It typically includes built-in examples, 
step-by-step execution, and real-time feedback, allowing learners to grasp concepts like recursion, sorting, trees, and graphs through hands-on practice. 
This kind of sandbox is ideal for beginners and advanced users alike, fostering deeper understanding through exploration and iterative learning.

# VIB Prompt


Write program demonstrate Backtracking Programming with Sudoku Solver Algorithm.

The file names are sudoku 
The folder names are backtracking 

Write HTML, JavaScript, canvass, CSS, JQuery, and Bootstrap. 
Put text fields for input values. 


Include the following directories.
 
../css/common.css"
../lib/jquery-3.7.1.min.js
../lib/bootstrap-5.3.8-dist/js/bootstrap.min.js
../lib/bootstrap-5.3.8-dist/css/bootstrap.min.css

Put the CSS in the following directory.
../css/<folder_names>/<file_name>.css

Put the JQuery in the following directory.
../js/<folder_names>/<file_name>.js
  
Have a setup and step button. The setup button initial the values of the program. The step button step through each step of the algorithm.
  
Graphically show each step of the algorithm.
