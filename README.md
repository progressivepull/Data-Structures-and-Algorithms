# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

A sandbox for learning [ Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)](https://progressivepull.github.io/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/) is an interactive, safe environment where users can experiment with code, 
visualize algorithm behavior, and test different data structures without fear of breaking anything. It typically includes built-in examples, 
step-by-step execution, and real-time feedback, allowing learners to grasp concepts like recursion, sorting, trees, and graphs through hands-on practice. 
This kind of sandbox is ideal for beginners and advanced users alike, fostering deeper understanding through exploration and iterative learning.
