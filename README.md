## üî¢ Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms arrange data in a specific order (ascending or descending).

### Common Types

- **Bubble Sort**: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- **Selection Sort**: Selects the smallest element and places it at the beginning.
- **Insertion Sort**: Builds the sorted array one item at a time.
- **Merge Sort**: Divides the array into halves, sorts them, and merges.
- **Quick Sort**: Picks a pivot and partitions the array around it.
- **Heap Sort**: Uses a heap data structure to sort elements.

---

## üîç Searching Algorithms

Searching algorithms find the position or existence of an element in a data structure.

### Common Types

- **Linear Search**: Checks each element one by one.
- **Binary Search**: Efficiently searches a sorted array by dividing the search space in half.

---

## üîÅ Recursion

Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem.

### Example

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

## üß© Backtracking

Backtracking explores all possible solutions and abandons paths that don‚Äôt lead to a valid solution. It is often used in constraint satisfaction problems and combinatorial optimization.

### Applications

- **N-Queens Problem**: Place N queens on an N√óN chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
- **Sudoku Solver**: Fill a 9√ó9 grid so that each row, column, and 3√ó3 box contains digits 1‚Äì9.
- **Maze Solving**: Find a path from start to finish by exploring all possible routes.

---

## ‚öîÔ∏è Divide and Conquer

Divide and conquer splits a problem into smaller subproblems, solves them independently, and combines the results. It is efficient for problems that can be recursively broken down.

### Examples

- **Merge Sort**: Divides the array, sorts each half, and merges them.
- **Quick Sort**: Partitions the array around a pivot and recursively sorts the partitions.
- **Binary Search**: Searches a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

---

## üí∞ Greedy Algorithms

Greedy algorithms make the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. They are fast and simple but may not always yield the best solution.

### Applications

- **Activity Selection**: Select the maximum number of activities that don‚Äôt overlap.
- **Huffman Coding**: Generate optimal prefix codes for data compression.
- **Fractional Knapsack**: Maximize value by taking fractions of items based on value-to-weight ratio.

---

## üß† Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming solves problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems and storing results to avoid recomputation. It is ideal for optimization problems.

### Techniques

- **Memoization**: Top-down approach with caching of results.
- **Tabulation**: Bottom-up approach using a table to store intermediate results.

### Examples

- **Fibonacci Sequence**: Compute nth Fibonacci number efficiently.
- **Longest Common Subsequence**: Find the longest sequence common to two strings.
- **0/1 Knapsack Problem**: Maximize value with weight constraints without item splitting.

---

## üåê Graph Algorithms

Graph algorithms solve problems related to networks of nodes and edges. They are used in routing, social networks, and dependency resolution.

### Common Algorithms

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores neighbors level by level.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- **Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm**: Finds shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes.
- **Kruskal‚Äôs and Prim‚Äôs Algorithms**: Construct minimum spanning trees.
