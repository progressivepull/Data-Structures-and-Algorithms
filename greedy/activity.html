                <h1>Explanation of Greedy Programming with Activity Selection Algorithm</h1>

                <h2>What is Greedy Programming?</h2>
                <p>Greedy programming is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit. It is an approach used to solve optimization problems. The core idea is to make a locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a globally optimal solution.</p>
                <p>Greedy algorithms are generally simple to implement and very efficient in terms of time complexity. However, they do not always guarantee a globally optimal solution for every problem. The Activity Selection Problem is one classic example where the greedy approach *does* yield the optimal solution.</p>

                <h2>The Activity Selection Problem</h2>
                <p>The problem is defined as follows: Given a set of <B>n</B> activities, each with a specific start time <b>s<sub>i</sub></b> and finish time <b>f<sub>i</sub></b>, the goal is to select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities.</p>
                <p>Two activities, <B>i</B> and <B>j</B>, are non-overlapping if their time intervals <b>s<sub>i</sub></b>, <b>f<sub>i</sub></b>and <b>s<sub>j</sub></b>, <b>f<sub>i</sub></b> do not intersect. This means either <b>f<sub>i</sub></b> <= <b>s<sub>j</sub></b> or <b>f<sub>j</sub></b> <= <b>s<sub>i</sub></b>.</p>

                <h2>The Greedy Approach for Activity Selection</h2>
                <p>The key to solving this problem efficiently is to choose activities based on their finish times. The most effective greedy strategy is to always pick the activity that finishes earliest among those that are compatible with the activities already selected.</p>

                <h3>The Algorithm Steps:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Sort:</strong> Sort all activities in ascending order of their finish times. This is the crucial greedy choice criteria.</li>
                    <li><strong>Select the First:</strong> Select the first activity (which has the earliest finish time).</li>
                    <li><strong>Iterate and Filter:</strong> Iterate through the remaining sorted activities. For each activity, check if its start time is greater than or equal to the finish time of the last selected activity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Add Compatible:</strong> If they are compatible (non-overlapping), select the current activity and update the last selected activity's finish time.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Why Does This Work?</h2>
                <p>By picking the activity that finishes soonest, we maximize the available time remaining for subsequent activities. If we picked an activity that finished later, even if it started early, it would limit the number of other potential activities that could fit after it.</p>

                <h2>Example Walkthrough</h2>

                <p>Consider the following set of activities (already sorted by finish time):</p>

                <table class="example-table">
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Activity ID</th>
                            <th>Start Time</th>
                            <th>Finish Time</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr><td>A1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>A2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>A3</td><td>0</td><td>6</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>A4</td><td>5</td><td>7</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>A5</td><td>8</td><td>9</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>A6</td><td>5</td><td>9</td></tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>

                <h3>Execution:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Step 1:</strong> Select <strong>A1</strong> (finishes at 2). The last finish time is now 2.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Consider A2 (starts at 3). 3 >= 2, so it is compatible. Select <strong>A2</strong> (finishes at 4). The last finish time is now 4.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Step 3:</strong> Consider A3 (starts at 0). 0 < 4, so it overlaps with A2. Reject A3.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Step 4:</strong> Consider A4 (starts at 5). 5 >= 4, so it is compatible. Select <strong>A4</strong> (finishes at 7). The last finish time is now 7.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Step 5:</strong> Consider A5 (starts at 8). 8 >= 7, so it is compatible. Select <strong>A5</strong> (finishes at 9). The last finish time is now 9.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Step 6:</strong> Consider A6 (starts at 5). 5 < 9, so it overlaps with A5. Reject A6.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>The maximum set of non-overlapping activities is {A1, A2, A4, A5}.</p>
